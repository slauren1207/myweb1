    <h1>"How Love Wins (Thief)"</h1>
    <h2>Steven Curtis Chapman</h2>
    <p>This is how Love wins, every single time</p>
    <p>Climbing high upon a tree where someone else should die</p>
    <p>This is how Love heals, the deepest part of you</p>
    <p>Letting Himself bleed into the middle of your wounds</p>
    <p>This is what Love says, standing at the door</p>
    <p>You don't have to be who you've been before</p>
    <p>Silenced by His voice, death can't speak again</p>
    <p>This is how Love wins</p>
